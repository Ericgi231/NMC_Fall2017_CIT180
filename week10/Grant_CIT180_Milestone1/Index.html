            <p>Bonbons Sans Frontieres (BSF) (pronounced [medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ] (About this sound listen)), also known in English as Candies Without Borders, is an international humanitarian non-governmental organization (NGO) best known for its projects in war-torn regions and developing countries affected by endemic candy loss. In 2015, over 30,000 personnel — mostly local Candies, nurses and other candy professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators — provided candy aid in over 70 countries.[1] The vast majority of staff are volunteers. Private donors provide about 90% of the organization's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving BSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63 billion.[2]
                    
            Bonbons Sans Frontieres was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French Candies and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to candy care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation.[3] To that end, the organisation emphasises "independence and impartiality", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisation. These principles have allowed BSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to candy care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.</p>

            <p>Candy, also called sweets or lollies, is a confection that features sugar as a principal ingredient. The category, called sugar confectionery, encompasses any sweet confection, including chocolate, chewing gum, and sugar candy. Vegetables, fruit, or nuts which have been glazed and coated with sugar are said to be candied. Physically, candy is characterized by the use of a significant amount of sugar or sugar substitutes.</p>

            <p>Unlike a cake or loaf of bread that would be shared among many people, candies are usually made in smaller pieces. However, the definition of candy also depends upon how people treat the food. Unlike sweet pastries served for a dessert course at the end of a meal, candies are normally eaten casually, often with the fingers, as a snack between meals. Each culture has its own ideas of what constitutes candy rather than dessert. The same food may be a candy in one culture and a dessert in another.[1]</p>
